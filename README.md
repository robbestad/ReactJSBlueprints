If you have any commments, issues or suggestions, please file an issue
in the relevant chapter repository.

I want you to be happy with the code and the book, so please contact me
and let me assist before you give and post a bad review somewhere :). I'd
like to expand on the ReactJS Blueprints experience by adding followup
code and examples here, so I'll be sure to update this README.md with new 
links.

###### A note on Heroku 

A lot of the chapters have examples published on Heroku. Towards the end of 
the month, Heroku may shut down access due to the large number of requests.
